========================================================

This fill will run the analysis on the UCI HAR Dataset. It will 
- Read the subject and the activites each from a seperate file. 
- Read the measurments 
- Combine all the above ( measurements , subjects , activites) in a single dataframe. 
- Then it will do the same for the second dataset ( training dataset)
- Then it will combine both dataframes. 
- And finally it'll extract only the columns that are related to the mean and Standard divation.
